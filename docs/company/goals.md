# Goals

## The Vision

The goals we set as a company depend on what we want the company to become. In one future, Koor is one of a few dominant players in the data storage space. There may be a few others with competitive solutions that address the same needs.

The open source community for Ceph and Rook data management creates the foundation for Koor. Koor simplifies the operation of these solutions, providing the tools and APIs to handle any data management action.

At maturity, Koor will be able to serve the data management needs of customer, whether they want to control it themselves or have Koor handle it for them.

## Milestones

We can identify milestones that will lead us to realize the company vision.

### 1. Establish a viable product

Everything that has happened since the start of Koor is in line with this milestone that Koor has not yet reached. A viable product is one that customers use, and that a subset of those customer pay to license. A good sign is a growing base of customers who are spending their time and money on the product.

In Koor's case, the product is Koor Storage Distribution, which is Rook plus additional tools and enhancements. KSD helps do-it-yourself data storage professionals to manage and resolve issues with their Ceph data clusters.

The point of having a viable product is to demonstrate to potential investors that Koor is on a promising growth path. The goal of this stage is to close a successful round of funding that will sustain Koor through the next milestone.

### 2. Empower data storage professionals


### 3. Use KSD to establish Koor's DaaS offering


### 4. World domination
