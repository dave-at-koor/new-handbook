# Vision

From our website:

Our vision is to challenge existing storage vendors which heavily rely on selling you hardware. Ceph has shown that you don’t need any particular custom hardware to have a reliable and performent storage for your applications. Kubernetes is everywhere and it is easier than ever to run a cluster yourself. We believe that the “Everything into the cloud” movement will come to a slow in the future.

Our product will enable our customers to move faster when they need persistent storage for their applications.

Through the improvements and features we are actively developing we want to achieve our vision. Our development roadmap below will give you an insight on how our progress is going.
